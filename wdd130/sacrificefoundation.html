      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Do you know how many people have prevented their own deaths by simply taking the time to think about it? The goal, is simple, obtain 1 Million Human sacrifices for our lord and savior Shaggy Rogers as it will allow the souls of the canines to return unto themselves, and they shall once again take their thrones. This website will be as for convenience, giving the volunteers and easy access to their free human sacrifice, and unlike most soul sucking businesses, this organization gives same day sacrifices, granting little time to the subject for self reflection. Not with the Rogers Sacrifice Foundation! With this system you will have only a few hours with a crate of cookies and milk before taking the relatively painless execution of His Graceâ€™s plan.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>Our audience is all mankind, as we shall all be His servants soon enough, why should anyone be left out of the oportunity to be part of this glourious purpose? Old, young, man, woman, cat, or dog, the great Lord accepts all to be His subjects.</p>  <!-- change this -->

        Shaggy is a God, and a well good Chad as shown in the picture bellow, wouldn't you want to be a part in His perfect plan to?
        Take a good long look, don't you want His buff chest, and ripped mustles to have your back, and your soul? I know it seems scarry,
        but take heart as you shall transend with him unto His glourious final form, and endure forever.
